# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose for this analysis is to utilize THREE different techniques to train and evaluate models with Unbalanced classes by using imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn.  For this Challenge, OVERSAMPLING the credit data was done using RandomOverSample and SMOTE(SYNTHETIC MINORITY OVERSAMPLING TECHNIQUE), which is a statinstcal technique for increasing the number of cases in your dataset in a balanced way.  It generates new instances from existing minority cases that the original data suppies as input.

UnderSampling was also used on the data, where
